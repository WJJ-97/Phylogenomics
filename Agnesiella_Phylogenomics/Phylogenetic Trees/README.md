This repository makes available the phylogenetic trees resulting from the study: **"Extensive hybridization and complex evolutionary history in the leafhopper genus *Agnesiella* (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae)."**

The repository includes two main categories of phylogenetic trees:
- **Coalescent-based trees:**  Trees inferred using ASTRAL-Hybrid, accounting for gene tree discordance.
- **Concatenation-based trees:** Trees inferred from concatenated datasets.
