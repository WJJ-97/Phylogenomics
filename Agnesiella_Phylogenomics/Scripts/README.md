This repository provides access to all scripts used in the research article: **"Extensive hybridization and complex evolutionary history in the leafhopper genus *Agnesiella* (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae)."**

The scripts are organized to facilitate reproducibility and include steps for:
- **Genome Assembly:** Scripts for assembling and annotating the *Agnesiella* genome.
- **Marker Extraction & Dataset Generation:** Scripts for extracting genetic markers and generating datasets for downstream analyses.
- **QuIBL Analysis:** Scripts for performing QuIBL (Quantifying Introgression via Branch Lengths) analysis.
- **Variant Calling & Filtering:** Scripts for variant calling and filtering to identify genetic variations.
